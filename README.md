# Lionstooth Software Website

The Lionstooth Software's website is a fairly simple static website that uses

- Webpack for building the website
- Babel for transpiling the latest ECMAScript (javascript) into code that browsers support
- SASS for better stylesheet management
- Pug for generating HTML from templates
- [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components) for UI (User Interface) components
- Line Awesome for icons

## Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Node.js

## Developing

Install dependencies using `npm install`.

Run the locally by using `npm start` and opening http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Changes to files under the `src/` directory will automatically trigger webpack to rebuild them and reload them in
your browser.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to build the static site in the `dist/` directory for deployment.

## Extending

Add more pages by creating new Pug files under `./src` (e.g. `./src/contact.pug`) and adding a new HtmlWebpackPlugin
to the plugins array in webpack.config.js.

If you need to support any new types of assets, you'll need to add them somewhere under `./src`, and
update the webpack configuration to be able to load them. (This may require installing additional Node.js modules).

If the new asset cannot be managed by webpack, then just add them to the `./public` directory. Webpack won't
automatically reload them when they change, but refreshing your browser will allow you to see the change.
