        Hi, I'm Eric. I recently left my comfortable corporate career as a Software Developer to become a bootstrapping
        entrepreneur. I started Lionstooth Software because I want to create applications and services that meet peoples'
        needs in unique and creative ways.
    p.
        A bootstrapped business usually starts with one founder on a tiny budget, avoids outside investment, and seeks
        organic long-term growth rather than forced growth (e.g. through paid advertising).
    p.
        The process I follow to bootstrap a business helps me weed out bad ideas early, learn what works and what doesn't along the way, and apply new
        knowledge as early as possible.
